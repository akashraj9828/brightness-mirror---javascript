# brightness-mirror---javascript
takes live feed from webcam and displays an low resolution video altered on basis of brightness level


this script takes raw input from your webcam so this wont run if you will directly open index.html  to run it you first need to make a local http-server where index.html is stored and then launch using http://127.0.0.1:"port"
